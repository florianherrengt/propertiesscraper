Find it on the top floor of a handsome semi-detached Edwardian house on the northern side of Grove Park, within the Camberwell Grove conservation area.Peckham Rye and Denmark Hill stations (both Zone 2) are your closest, with regular and London Overground services. Walk to either in just 10 minutes. London Bridge, London Victoria, Clapham Junction, Kings Cross St Pancras and Canary Wharf (via Canada Water), among other destinations, are quickly reached. Leasehold. Open into the neat communal hall. Ascend via stairs to the first floor and your own front door. From here you take your own stairs (admiring the large sash window) to the landing on the second floor. From here your kitchen sits to your right. It's wood-rich and hand-built, and casement windows look out onto leafy trees and pretty street views. Next door is the natural reception room of 16 feet by 13 with wooden floor boards, and behind this another huge room of 18 feet by 13 - which works beautifully as an oversized master bedroom (or you could switch these round if you preferred your reception room at the back of the building to garden views). Down a couple of stairs from the landing and you have a neat second double bedroom (this time of over 11 feet by over 9) and the property's bathroom, which is a neat white affair with cool ridged-glass Crittal window. Outside space? The rear section of the huge garden is demised to the flat and you access this at the side of the building via gate. Mature trees frame the space and you have a large lawned area.A top and enviable spot to call home. Brilliant Bellenden Road is a 10 minute walk away with eateries such as Artusi, The Begging Bowl and Ganapati, and independent shops such as The General Store and Review. Cafe culture is alive and buzzing; check out Anderson's on Bellenden Road, and Small White Elephant and Petitou on Choumert Road. Central Camberwell is a similar distance by foot. Here we like The Camberwell Arms, Theo's, The Hill Bakery (which sells delicious cheese too!) and The Crooked Well especially. Camberwell leisure centre is also a good spot for a smart Victorian pool, and good gym facilities plus classes. Or pop down to Butterfly Tennis Club or Zen Yoga. Both are even closer, at the foot of Camberwell Grove.Lettsom Gardens is popular with locals; you can get your key for a nominal yearly fee. A large Sainsbury's store is close by on Dog Kennel Hill, by Dulwich Hamlet FC. Local parks include Ruskin Park - with bandstand events throughout the summer, Warwick Gardens and Peckham Rye Park and Common. Central Peckham is quite the cultural and social hub, with funky Peckham Levels, and Frank's and The Bussey Building's rooftop bars in the warmer months, alongside Peckham Plex Cinema, banks and handy high street shops on Rye Lane. There's more to come for the area too: Peckham Rye Station is being improved and reworked, with the area around it, and watch this space for The Peckham Coal Line."},{"url":"https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-92517206.html","address":"Southdown Road, Wimbledon","imageUrl":"https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/56k/55561/92517206/55561_2227485_IMG_01_0000_max_656x437.JPG","description":"A truly impressive three double bedroom top floor maisonette recently developed to a fantastic spec throughout offering in excess of 1000 sq ft and offered to market with no onward chain.This lovely property boasts an abundance of natural light throughout and a private garden with a southerly aspect.

Walk to either in just 10 minutes. London Bridge, London Victoria, Clapham Junction, Kings Cross St Pancras and Canary Wharf (via Canada Water), among other destinations, are quickly reached. Leasehold. Open into the neat communal hall. Ascend via stairs to the first floor and your own front door. From here you take your own stairs (admiring the large sash window) to the landing on the second floor. From here your kitchen sits to your right. It's wood-rich and hand-built, and casement windows look out onto leafy trees and pretty street views. Next door is the natural reception room of 16 feet by 13 with wooden floor boards, and behind this another huge room of 18 feet by 13 - which works beautifully as an oversized master bedroom (or you could switch these round if you preferred your reception room at the back of the building to garden views). Down a couple of stairs from the landing and you have a neat second double bedroom (this time of over 11 feet by over 9) and the property's bathroom, which is a neat white affair with cool ridged-glass Crittal window. Outside space? The rear section of the huge garden is demised to the flat and you access this at the side of the building via gate. Mature trees frame the space and you have a large lawned area.A top and enviable spot to call home. Brilliant Bellenden Road is a 10 minute walk away with eateries such as Artusi, The Begging Bowl and Ganapati, and independent shops such as The General Store and Review. Cafe culture is alive and buzzing; check out Anderson's on Bellenden Road, and Small White Elephant and Petitou on Choumert Road. Central Camberwell is a similar distance by foot. Here we like The Camberwell Arms, Theo's, The Hill Bakery (which sells delicious cheese too!) and The Crooked Well especially. Camberwell leisure centre is also a good spot for a smart Victorian pool, and good gym facilities plus classes. Or pop down to Butterfly Tennis Club or Zen Yoga. Both are even closer, at the foot of Camberwell Grove.Lettsom Gardens is popular with locals; you can get your key for a nominal yearly fee. A large Sainsbury's store is close by on Dog Kennel Hill, by Dulwich Hamlet FC. Local parks include Ruskin Park - with bandstand events throughout the summer, Warwick Gardens and Peckham Rye Park and Common. Central Peckham is quite the cultural and social hub, with funky Peckham Levels, and Frank's and The Bussey Building's rooftop bars in the warmer months, alongside Peckham Plex Cinema, banks and handy high street shops on Rye Lane. There's more to come for the area too: Peckham Rye Station is being improved and reworked, with the area around it, and watch this space for The Peckham Coal Line."},{"url":"https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-92517206.html","address":"Southdown Road, Wimbledon","imageUrl":"https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/56k/55561/92517206/55561_2227485_IMG_01_0000_max_656x437.JPG","description":"A truly impressive three double bedroom top floor maisonette recently developed to a fantastic spec throughout offering in excess of 1000 sq ft and offered to market with no onward chain.This lovely property boasts an abundance of natural light throughout and a private garden with a southerly aspect.

Forming part of Thomas Read Kemp’s (1782-1844) vision for the luxurious estate of ‘Kemp Town’, Sussex Square was built between 1823-1827 by the renowned architect Amon Wilds and designed by Charles Busby. With distinctive Doric or Ionic porches, and ironwork balconies, the ornate design of the Square’s houses boast an elegant and eye-catching aesthetic. Subsequently, Sussex Square became an illustrious address favoured by nobility and celebrated intellectuals including Lewis Caroll, the author of the beloved Alice in Wonderland books. Having its own private gardens (with a tunnel granting direct access to the beach) and Grade I listed status, today Sussex Square upholds its reputation as a greatly desired residence within Brighton and Hove. Kemptown offers vibrant culture and fresh air in abundance with the seafront just a short stroll away. Within Kemptown Village and heading towards St James’s Street there are a variety of quirky boutiques, restaurants, cafés and pubs before leading to Brighton city centre and the North Laine.  Transport links include good access to the A259 and A27 road networks and accessible bus services extend across Brighton & Hove. The location affords excellent proximity to several distinguished schools, such as Brighton College (named Independent School of the Year 2019) and Roedean School."},{"url":"https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-92622974.html","address":"Devonshire Road, Tooting","imageUrl":"https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/56k/55543/92622974/55543_2231879_IMG_01_0000_max_656x437.JPG","description":"A bright and spacious two bedroom period conversion flat for sale, located within reach of both Tooting Broadway and Colliers Wood underground stations and local amenities.This stylish property offers 880 sq ft of well proportioned accommodation and is positioned on the top floor of this imposing period building.

Forming part of Thomas Read Kemp’s (1782-1844) vision for the luxurious estate of ‘Kemp Town’, Sussex Square was built between 1823-1827 by the renowned architect Amon Wilds and designed by Charles Busby. With distinctive Doric or Ionic porches, and ironwork balconies, the ornate design of the Square’s houses boast an elegant and eye-catching aesthetic. Subsequently, Sussex Square became an illustrious address favoured by nobility and celebrated intellectuals including Lewis Caroll, the author of the beloved Alice in Wonderland books. Having its own private gardens (with a tunnel granting direct access to the beach) and Grade I listed status, today Sussex Square upholds its reputation as a greatly desired residence within Brighton and Hove. Kemptown offers vibrant culture and fresh air in abundance with the seafront just a short stroll away. Within Kemptown Village and heading towards St James’s Street there are a variety of quirky boutiques, restaurants, cafés and pubs before leading to Brighton city centre and the North Laine.  Transport links include good access to the A259 and A27 road networks and accessible bus services extend across Brighton & Hove.

Walk to either in just 10 minutes. London Bridge, London Victoria, Clapham Junction, Kings Cross St Pancras and Canary Wharf (via Canada Water), among other destinations, are quickly reached. Leasehold. Open into the neat communal hall. Ascend via stairs to the first floor and your own front door. From here you take your own stairs (admiring the large sash window) to the landing on the second floor. From here your kitchen sits to your right. It's wood-rich and hand-built, and casement windows look out onto leafy trees and pretty street views. Next door is the natural reception room of 16 feet by 13 with wooden floor boards, and behind this another huge room of 18 feet by 13 - which works beautifully as an oversized master bedroom (or you could switch these round if you preferred your reception room at the back of the building to garden views). Down a couple of stairs from the landing and you have a neat second double bedroom (this time of over 11 feet by over 9) and the property's bathroom, which is a neat white affair with cool ridged-glass Crittal window. Outside space? The rear section of the huge garden is demised to the flat and you access this at the side of the building via gate. Mature trees frame the space and you have a large lawned area.A top and enviable spot to call home. Brilliant Bellenden Road is a 10 minute walk away with eateries such as Artusi, The Begging Bowl and Ganapati, and independent shops such as The General Store and Review. Cafe culture is alive and buzzing; check out Anderson's on Bellenden Road, and Small White Elephant and Petitou on Choumert Road. Central Camberwell is a similar distance by foot. Here we like The Camberwell Arms, Theo's, The Hill Bakery (which sells delicious cheese too!) and The Crooked Well especially. Camberwell leisure centre is also a good spot for a smart Victorian pool, and good gym facilities plus classes. Or pop down to Butterfly Tennis Club or Zen Yoga. Both are even closer, at the foot of Camberwell Grove.Lettsom Gardens is popular with locals; you can get your key for a nominal yearly fee. A large Sainsbury's store is close by on Dog Kennel Hill, by Dulwich Hamlet FC. Local parks include Ruskin Park - with bandstand events throughout the summer, Warwick Gardens and Peckham Rye Park and Common. Central Peckham is quite the cultural and social hub, with funky Peckham Levels, and Frank's and The Bussey Building's rooftop bars in the warmer months, alongside Peckham Plex Cinema, banks and handy high street shops on Rye Lane. There's more to come for the area too: Peckham Rye Station is being improved and reworked, with the area around it, and watch this space for The Peckham Coal Line."},{"url":"https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-92517206.html","address":"Southdown Road, Wimbledon","imageUrl":"https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/56k/55561/92517206/55561_2227485_IMG_01_0000_max_656x437.JPG","description":"A truly impressive three double bedroom top floor maisonette recently developed to a fantastic spec throughout offering in excess of 1000 sq ft and offered to market with no onward chain.This lovely property boasts an abundance of natural light throughout and a private garden with a southerly aspect.

Forming part of Thomas Read Kemp’s (1782-1844) vision for the luxurious estate of ‘Kemp Town’, Sussex Square was built between 1823-1827 by the renowned architect Amon Wilds and designed by Charles Busby. With distinctive Doric or Ionic porches, and ironwork balconies, the ornate design of the Square’s houses boast an elegant and eye-catching aesthetic. Subsequently, Sussex Square became an illustrious address favoured by nobility and celebrated intellectuals including Lewis Caroll, the author of the beloved Alice in Wonderland books. Having its own private gardens (with a tunnel granting direct access to the beach) and Grade I listed status, today Sussex Square upholds its reputation as a greatly desired residence within Brighton and Hove. Kemptown offers vibrant culture and fresh air in abundance with the seafront just a short stroll away. Within Kemptown Village and heading towards St James’s Street there are a variety of quirky boutiques, restaurants, cafés and pubs before leading to Brighton city centre and the North Laine.  Transport links include good access to the A259 and A27 road networks and accessible bus services extend across Brighton & Hove. The location affords excellent proximity to several distinguished schools, such as Brighton College (named Independent School of the Year 2019) and Roedean School."},{"url":"https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-92622974.html","address":"Devonshire Road, Tooting","imageUrl":"https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/56k/55543/92622974/55543_2231879_IMG_01_0000_max_656x437.JPG","description":"A bright and spacious two bedroom period conversion flat for sale, located within reach of both Tooting Broadway and Colliers Wood underground stations and local amenities.This stylish property offers 880 sq ft of well proportioned accommodation and is positioned on the top floor of this imposing period building.

Forming part of Thomas Read Kemp’s (1782-1844) vision for the luxurious estate of ‘Kemp Town’, Sussex Square was built between 1823-1827 by the renowned architect Amon Wilds and designed by Charles Busby. With distinctive Doric or Ionic porches, and ironwork balconies, the ornate design of the Square’s houses boast an elegant and eye-catching aesthetic. Subsequently, Sussex Square became an illustrious address favoured by nobility and celebrated intellectuals including Lewis Caroll, the author of the beloved Alice in Wonderland books. Having its own private gardens (with a tunnel granting direct access to the beach) and Grade I listed status, today Sussex Square upholds its reputation as a greatly desired residence within Brighton and Hove. Kemptown offers vibrant culture and fresh air in abundance with the seafront just a short stroll away. Within Kemptown Village and heading towards St James’s Street there are a variety of quirky boutiques, restaurants, cafés and pubs before leading to Brighton city centre and the North Laine.  Transport links include good access to the A259 and A27 road networks and accessible bus services extend across Brighton & Hove. The location affords excellent proximity to several distinguished schools, such as Brighton College (named Independent School of the Year 2019) and Roedean School."},{"url":"https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-92622974.html","address":"Devonshire Road, Tooting","imageUrl":"https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/56k/55543/92622974/55543_2231879_IMG_01_0000_max_656x437.JPG","description":"A bright and spacious two bedroom period conversion flat for sale, located within reach of both Tooting Broadway and Colliers Wood underground stations and local amenities.This stylish property offers 880 sq ft of well proportioned accommodation and is positioned on the top floor of this imposing period building.

Forming part of Thomas Read Kemp’s (1782-1844) vision for the luxurious estate of ‘Kemp Town’, Sussex Square was built between 1823-1827 by the renowned architect Amon Wilds and designed by Charles Busby. With distinctive Doric or Ionic porches, and ironwork balconies, the ornate design of the Square’s houses boast an elegant and eye-catching aesthetic. Subsequently, Sussex Square became an illustrious address favoured by nobility and celebrated intellectuals including Lewis Caroll, the author of the beloved Alice in Wonderland books. Having its own private gardens (with a tunnel granting direct access to the beach) and Grade I listed status, today Sussex Square upholds its reputation as a greatly desired residence within Brighton and Hove. Kemptown offers vibrant culture and fresh air in abundance with the seafront just a short stroll away. Within Kemptown Village and heading towards St James’s Street there are a variety of quirky boutiques, restaurants, cafés and pubs before leading to Brighton city centre and the North Laine.  Transport links include good access to the A259 and A27 road networks and accessible bus services extend across Brighton & Hove.

Forming part of Thomas Read Kemp’s (1782-1844) vision for the luxurious estate of ‘Kemp Town’, Sussex Square was built between 1823-1827 by the renowned architect Amon Wilds and designed by Charles Busby. With distinctive Doric or Ionic porches, and ironwork balconies, the ornate design of the Square’s houses boast an elegant and eye-catching aesthetic. Subsequently, Sussex Square became an illustrious address favoured by nobility and celebrated intellectuals including Lewis Caroll, the author of the beloved Alice in Wonderland books. Having its own private gardens (with a tunnel granting direct access to the beach) and Grade I listed status, today Sussex Square upholds its reputation as a greatly desired residence within Brighton and Hove. Kemptown offers vibrant culture and fresh air in abundance with the seafront just a short stroll away. Within Kemptown Village and heading towards St James’s Street there are a variety of quirky boutiques, restaurants, cafés and pubs before leading to Brighton city centre and the North Laine.  Transport links include good access to the A259 and A27 road networks and accessible bus services extend across Brighton & Hove. The location affords excellent proximity to several distinguished schools, such as Brighton College (named Independent School of the Year 2019) and Roedean School."},{"url":"https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-92622974.html","address":"Devonshire Road, Tooting","imageUrl":"https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/56k/55543/92622974/55543_2231879_IMG_01_0000_max_656x437.JPG","description":"A bright and spacious two bedroom period conversion flat for sale, located within reach of both Tooting Broadway and Colliers Wood underground stations and local amenities.This stylish property offers 880 sq ft of well proportioned accommodation and is positioned on the top floor of this imposing period building.

Forming part of Thomas Read Kemp’s (1782-1844) vision for the luxurious estate of ‘Kemp Town’, Sussex Square was built between 1823-1827 by the renowned architect Amon Wilds and designed by Charles Busby. With distinctive Doric or Ionic porches, and ironwork balconies, the ornate design of the Square’s houses boast an elegant and eye-catching aesthetic. Subsequently, Sussex Square became an illustrious address favoured by nobility and celebrated intellectuals including Lewis Caroll, the author of the beloved Alice in Wonderland books. Having its own private gardens (with a tunnel granting direct access to the beach) and Grade I listed status, today Sussex Square upholds its reputation as a greatly desired residence within Brighton and Hove. Kemptown offers vibrant culture and fresh air in abundance with the seafront just a short stroll away. Within Kemptown Village and heading towards St James’s Street there are a variety of quirky boutiques, restaurants, cafés and pubs before leading to Brighton city centre and the North Laine.  Transport links include good access to the A259 and A27 road networks and accessible bus services extend across Brighton & Hove. The location affords excellent proximity to several distinguished schools, such as Brighton College (named Independent School of the Year 2019) and Roedean School."},{"url":"https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-92622974.html","address":"Devonshire Road, Tooting","imageUrl":"https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/56k/55543/92622974/55543_2231879_IMG_01_0000_max_656x437.JPG","description":"A bright and spacious two bedroom period conversion flat for sale, located within reach of both Tooting Broadway and Colliers Wood underground stations and local amenities.This stylish property offers 880 sq ft of well proportioned accommodation and is positioned on the top floor of this imposing period building.

Forming part of Thomas Read Kemp’s (1782-1844) vision for the luxurious estate of ‘Kemp Town’, Sussex Square was built between 1823-1827 by the renowned architect Amon Wilds and designed by Charles Busby. With distinctive Doric or Ionic porches, and ironwork balconies, the ornate design of the Square’s houses boast an elegant and eye-catching aesthetic. Subsequently, Sussex Square became an illustrious address favoured by nobility and celebrated intellectuals including Lewis Caroll, the author of the beloved Alice in Wonderland books. Having its own private gardens (with a tunnel granting direct access to the beach) and Grade I listed status, today Sussex Square upholds its reputation as a greatly desired residence within Brighton and Hove. Kemptown offers vibrant culture and fresh air in abundance with the seafront just a short stroll away. Within Kemptown Village and heading towards St James’s Street there are a variety of quirky boutiques, restaurants, cafés and pubs before leading to Brighton city centre and the North Laine.  Transport links include good access to the A259 and A27 road networks and accessible bus services extend across Brighton & Hove. The location affords excellent proximity to several distinguished schools, such as Brighton College (named Independent School of the Year 2019) and Roedean School."},{"url":"https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-92622974.html","address":"Devonshire Road, Tooting","imageUrl":"https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/56k/55543/92622974/55543_2231879_IMG_01_0000_max_656x437.JPG","description":"A bright and spacious two bedroom period conversion flat for sale, located within reach of both Tooting Broadway and Colliers Wood underground stations and local amenities.This stylish property offers 880 sq ft of well proportioned accommodation and is positioned on the top floor of this imposing period building.

Forming part of Thomas Read Kemp’s (1782-1844) vision for the luxurious estate of ‘Kemp Town’, Sussex Square was built between 1823-1827 by the renowned architect Amon Wilds and designed by Charles Busby. With distinctive Doric or Ionic porches, and ironwork balconies, the ornate design of the Square’s houses boast an elegant and eye-catching aesthetic. Subsequently, Sussex Square became an illustrious address favoured by nobility and celebrated intellectuals including Lewis Caroll, the author of the beloved Alice in Wonderland books. Having its own private gardens (with a tunnel granting direct access to the beach) and Grade I listed status, today Sussex Square upholds its reputation as a greatly desired residence within Brighton and Hove. Kemptown offers vibrant culture and fresh air in abundance with the seafront just a short stroll away. Within Kemptown Village and heading towards St James’s Street there are a variety of quirky boutiques, restaurants, cafés and pubs before leading to Brighton city centre and the North Laine.  Transport links include good access to the A259 and A27 road networks and accessible bus services extend across Brighton & Hove. The location affords excellent proximity to several distinguished schools, such as Brighton College (named Independent School of the Year 2019) and Roedean School."},{"url":"https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-92622974.html","address":"Devonshire Road, Tooting","imageUrl":"https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/56k/55543/92622974/55543_2231879_IMG_01_0000_max_656x437.JPG","description":"A bright and spacious two bedroom period conversion flat for sale, located within reach of both Tooting Broadway and Colliers Wood underground stations and local amenities.This stylish property offers 880 sq ft of well proportioned accommodation and is positioned on the top floor of this imposing period building.

Forming part of Thomas Read Kemp’s (1782-1844) vision for the luxurious estate of ‘Kemp Town’, Sussex Square was built between 1823-1827 by the renowned architect Amon Wilds and designed by Charles Busby. With distinctive Doric or Ionic porches, and ironwork balconies, the ornate design of the Square’s houses boast an elegant and eye-catching aesthetic. Subsequently, Sussex Square became an illustrious address favoured by nobility and celebrated intellectuals including Lewis Caroll, the author of the beloved Alice in Wonderland books. Having its own private gardens (with a tunnel granting direct access to the beach) and Grade I listed status, today Sussex Square upholds its reputation as a greatly desired residence within Brighton and Hove. Kemptown offers vibrant culture and fresh air in abundance with the seafront just a short stroll away. Within Kemptown Village and heading towards St James’s Street there are a variety of quirky boutiques, restaurants, cafés and pubs before leading to Brighton city centre and the North Laine.  Transport links include good access to the A259 and A27 road networks and accessible bus services extend across Brighton & Hove.

Forming part of Thomas Read Kemp’s (1782-1844) vision for the luxurious estate of ‘Kemp Town’, Sussex Square was built between 1823-1827 by the renowned architect Amon Wilds and designed by Charles Busby. With distinctive Doric or Ionic porches, and ironwork balconies, the ornate design of the Square’s houses boast an elegant and eye-catching aesthetic. Subsequently, Sussex Square became an illustrious address favoured by nobility and celebrated intellectuals including Lewis Caroll, the author of the beloved Alice in Wonderland books. Having its own private gardens (with a tunnel granting direct access to the beach) and Grade I listed status, today Sussex Square upholds its reputation as a greatly desired residence within Brighton and Hove. Kemptown offers vibrant culture and fresh air in abundance with the seafront just a short stroll away. Within Kemptown Village and heading towards St James’s Street there are a variety of quirky boutiques, restaurants, cafés and pubs before leading to Brighton city centre and the North Laine.  Transport links include good access to the A259 and A27 road networks and accessible bus services extend across Brighton & Hove.

Forming part of Thomas Read Kemp’s (1782-1844) vision for the luxurious estate of ‘Kemp Town’, Sussex Square was built between 1823-1827 by the renowned architect Amon Wilds and designed by Charles Busby. With distinctive Doric or Ionic porches, and ironwork balconies, the ornate design of the Square’s houses boast an elegant and eye-catching aesthetic. Subsequently, Sussex Square became an illustrious address favoured by nobility and celebrated intellectuals including Lewis Caroll, the author of the beloved Alice in Wonderland books. Having its own private gardens (with a tunnel granting direct access to the beach) and Grade I listed status, today Sussex Square upholds its reputation as a greatly desired residence within Brighton and Hove. Kemptown offers vibrant culture and fresh air in abundance with the seafront just a short stroll away. Within Kemptown Village and heading towards St James’s Street there are a variety of quirky boutiques, restaurants, cafés and pubs before leading to Brighton city centre and the North Laine.  Transport links include good access to the A259 and A27 road networks and accessible bus services extend across Brighton & Hove. The location affords excellent proximity to several distinguished schools, such as Brighton College (named Independent School of the Year 2019) and Roedean School."},{"url":"https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-92622974.html","address":"Devonshire Road, Tooting","imageUrl":"https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/56k/55543/92622974/55543_2231879_IMG_01_0000_max_656x437.JPG","description":"A bright and spacious two bedroom period conversion flat for sale, located within reach of both Tooting Broadway and Colliers Wood underground stations and local amenities.This stylish property offers 880 sq ft of well proportioned accommodation and is positioned on the top floor of this imposing period building.

Walk to either in just 10 minutes. London Bridge, London Victoria, Clapham Junction, Kings Cross St Pancras and Canary Wharf (via Canada Water), among other destinations, are quickly reached. Leasehold. Open into the neat communal hall. Ascend via stairs to the first floor and your own front door. From here you take your own stairs (admiring the large sash window) to the landing on the second floor. From here your kitchen sits to your right. It's wood-rich and hand-built, and casement windows look out onto leafy trees and pretty street views. Next door is the natural reception room of 16 feet by 13 with wooden floor boards, and behind this another huge room of 18 feet by 13 - which works beautifully as an oversized master bedroom (or you could switch these round if you preferred your reception room at the back of the building to garden views). Down a couple of stairs from the landing and you have a neat second double bedroom (this time of over 11 feet by over 9) and the property's bathroom, which is a neat white affair with cool ridged-glass Crittal window. Outside space? The rear section of the huge garden is demised to the flat and you access this at the side of the building via gate. Mature trees frame the space and you have a large lawned area.A top and enviable spot to call home. Brilliant Bellenden Road is a 10 minute walk away with eateries such as Artusi, The Begging Bowl and Ganapati, and independent shops such as The General Store and Review. Cafe culture is alive and buzzing; check out Anderson's on Bellenden Road, and Small White Elephant and Petitou on Choumert Road. Central Camberwell is a similar distance by foot. Here we like The Camberwell Arms, Theo's, The Hill Bakery (which sells delicious cheese too!) and The Crooked Well especially. Camberwell leisure centre is also a good spot for a smart Victorian pool, and good gym facilities plus classes. Or pop down to Butterfly Tennis Club or Zen Yoga. Both are even closer, at the foot of Camberwell Grove.Lettsom Gardens is popular with locals; you can get your key for a nominal yearly fee. A large Sainsbury's store is close by on Dog Kennel Hill, by Dulwich Hamlet FC. Local parks include Ruskin Park - with bandstand events throughout the summer, Warwick Gardens and Peckham Rye Park and Common. Central Peckham is quite the cultural and social hub, with funky Peckham Levels, and Frank's and The Bussey Building's rooftop bars in the warmer months, alongside Peckham Plex Cinema, banks and handy high street shops on Rye Lane. There's more to come for the area too: Peckham Rye Station is being improved and reworked, with the area around it, and watch this space for The Peckham Coal Line."},{"url":"https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-92517206.html","address":"Southdown Road, Wimbledon","imageUrl":"https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/56k/55561/92517206/55561_2227485_IMG_01_0000_max_656x437.JPG","description":"A truly impressive three double bedroom top floor maisonette recently developed to a fantastic spec throughout offering in excess of 1000 sq ft and offered to market with no onward chain.This lovely property boasts an abundance of natural light throughout and a private garden with a southerly aspect.

Forming part of Thomas Read Kemp’s (1782-1844) vision for the luxurious estate of ‘Kemp Town’, Sussex Square was built between 1823-1827 by the renowned architect Amon Wilds and designed by Charles Busby. With distinctive Doric or Ionic porches, and ironwork balconies, the ornate design of the Square’s houses boast an elegant and eye-catching aesthetic. Subsequently, Sussex Square became an illustrious address favoured by nobility and celebrated intellectuals including Lewis Caroll, the author of the beloved Alice in Wonderland books. Having its own private gardens (with a tunnel granting direct access to the beach) and Grade I listed status, today Sussex Square upholds its reputation as a greatly desired residence within Brighton and Hove. Kemptown offers vibrant culture and fresh air in abundance with the seafront just a short stroll away. Within Kemptown Village and heading towards St James’s Street there are a variety of quirky boutiques, restaurants, cafés and pubs before leading to Brighton city centre and the North Laine.  Transport links include good access to the A259 and A27 road networks and accessible bus services extend across Brighton & Hove. The location affords excellent proximity to several distinguished schools, such as Brighton College (named Independent School of the Year 2019) and Roedean School."},{"url":"https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-92622974.html","address":"Devonshire Road, Tooting","imageUrl":"https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/56k/55543/92622974/55543_2231879_IMG_01_0000_max_656x437.JPG","description":"A bright and spacious two bedroom period conversion flat for sale, located within reach of both Tooting Broadway and Colliers Wood underground stations and local amenities.This stylish property offers 880 sq ft of well proportioned accommodation and is positioned on the top floor of this imposing period building.

Forming part of Thomas Read Kemp’s (1782-1844) vision for the luxurious estate of ‘Kemp Town’, Sussex Square was built between 1823-1827 by the renowned architect Amon Wilds and designed by Charles Busby. With distinctive Doric or Ionic porches, and ironwork balconies, the ornate design of the Square’s houses boast an elegant and eye-catching aesthetic. Subsequently, Sussex Square became an illustrious address favoured by nobility and celebrated intellectuals including Lewis Caroll, the author of the beloved Alice in Wonderland books. Having its own private gardens (with a tunnel granting direct access to the beach) and Grade I listed status, today Sussex Square upholds its reputation as a greatly desired residence within Brighton and Hove. Kemptown offers vibrant culture and fresh air in abundance with the seafront just a short stroll away. Within Kemptown Village and heading towards St James’s Street there are a variety of quirky boutiques, restaurants, cafés and pubs before leading to Brighton city centre and the North Laine.  Transport links include good access to the A259 and A27 road networks and accessible bus services extend across Brighton & Hove. The location affords excellent proximity to several distinguished schools, such as Brighton College (named Independent School of the Year 2019) and Roedean School."},{"url":"https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-92622974.html","address":"Devonshire Road, Tooting","imageUrl":"https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/56k/55543/92622974/55543_2231879_IMG_01_0000_max_656x437.JPG","description":"A bright and spacious two bedroom period conversion flat for sale, located within reach of both Tooting Broadway and Colliers Wood underground stations and local amenities.This stylish property offers 880 sq ft of well proportioned accommodation and is positioned on the top floor of this imposing period building.

Mature trees frame the space and you have a large lawned area.A top and enviable spot to call home. Brilliant Bellenden Road is a 10 minute walk away with eateries such as Artusi, The Begging Bowl and Ganapati, and independent shops such as The General Store and Review. Cafe culture is alive and buzzing; check out Anderson's on Bellenden Road, and Small White Elephant and Petitou on Choumert Road. Central Camberwell is a similar distance by foot. Here we like The Camberwell Arms, Theo's, The Hill Bakery (which sells delicious cheese too!) and The Crooked Well especially. Camberwell leisure centre is also a good spot for a smart Victorian pool, and good gym facilities plus classes. Or pop down to Butterfly Tennis Club or Zen Yoga. Both are even closer, at the foot of Camberwell Grove.Lettsom Gardens is popular with locals; you can get your key for a nominal yearly fee. A large Sainsbury's store is close by on Dog Kennel Hill, by Dulwich Hamlet FC. Local parks include Ruskin Park - with bandstand events throughout the summer, Warwick Gardens and Peckham Rye Park and Common. Central Peckham is quite the cultural and social hub, with funky Peckham Levels, and Frank's and The Bussey Building's rooftop bars in the warmer months, alongside Peckham Plex Cinema, banks and handy high street shops on Rye Lane. There's more to come for the area too: Peckham Rye Station is being improved and reworked, with the area around it, and watch this space for The Peckham Coal Line."},{"url":"https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-92517206.html","address":"Southdown Road, Wimbledon","imageUrl":"https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/56k/55561/92517206/55561_2227485_IMG_01_0000_max_656x437.JPG","description":"A truly impressive three double bedroom top floor maisonette recently developed to a fantastic spec throughout offering in excess of 1000 sq ft and offered to market with no onward chain.This lovely property boasts an abundance of natural light throughout and a private garden with a southerly aspect.

Forming part of Thomas Read Kemp’s (1782-1844) vision for the luxurious estate of ‘Kemp Town’, Sussex Square was built between 1823-1827 by the renowned architect Amon Wilds and designed by Charles Busby. With distinctive Doric or Ionic porches, and ironwork balconies, the ornate design of the Square’s houses boast an elegant and eye-catching aesthetic. Subsequently, Sussex Square became an illustrious address favoured by nobility and celebrated intellectuals including Lewis Caroll, the author of the beloved Alice in Wonderland books. Having its own private gardens (with a tunnel granting direct access to the beach) and Grade I listed status, today Sussex Square upholds its reputation as a greatly desired residence within Brighton and Hove. Kemptown offers vibrant culture and fresh air in abundance with the seafront just a short stroll away.

Forming part of Thomas Read Kemp’s (1782-1844) vision for the luxurious estate of ‘Kemp Town’, Sussex Square was built between 1823-1827 by the renowned architect Amon Wilds and designed by Charles Busby. With distinctive Doric or Ionic porches, and ironwork balconies, the ornate design of the Square’s houses boast an elegant and eye-catching aesthetic. Subsequently, Sussex Square became an illustrious address favoured by nobility and celebrated intellectuals including Lewis Caroll, the author of the beloved Alice in Wonderland books. Having its own private gardens (with a tunnel granting direct access to the beach) and Grade I listed status, today Sussex Square upholds its reputation as a greatly desired residence within Brighton and Hove. Kemptown offers vibrant culture and fresh air in abundance with the seafront just a short stroll away. Within Kemptown Village and heading towards St James’s Street there are a variety of quirky boutiques, restaurants, cafés and pubs before leading to Brighton city centre and the North Laine.  Transport links include good access to the A259 and A27 road networks and accessible bus services extend across Brighton & Hove.

Forming part of Thomas Read Kemp’s (1782-1844) vision for the luxurious estate of ‘Kemp Town’, Sussex Square was built between 1823-1827 by the renowned architect Amon Wilds and designed by Charles Busby. With distinctive Doric or Ionic porches, and ironwork balconies, the ornate design of the Square’s houses boast an elegant and eye-catching aesthetic. Subsequently, Sussex Square became an illustrious address favoured by nobility and celebrated intellectuals including Lewis Caroll, the author of the beloved Alice in Wonderland books. Having its own private gardens (with a tunnel granting direct access to the beach) and Grade I listed status, today Sussex Square upholds its reputation as a greatly desired residence within Brighton and Hove. Kemptown offers vibrant culture and fresh air in abundance with the seafront just a short stroll away. Within Kemptown Village and heading towards St James’s Street there are a variety of quirky boutiques, restaurants, cafés and pubs before leading to Brighton city centre and the North Laine.  Transport links include good access to the A259 and A27 road networks and accessible bus services extend across Brighton & Hove.
